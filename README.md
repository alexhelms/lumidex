# Lumidex

Organize your astrophotography library.

Lumidex scans folders with your image files, reads the headers, and builds a database.
Data is never altered in any way.

> [!WARNING]
> Lumidex is very early in development and unstable.
> For the time being you must build Lumidex to use it.

## Features

- Search -> Search your library to find the images you're looking for
- Aliases -> Assign multiple names to object names from the headers
- Tags -> Group your images with tags
- Quick Scan -> only scan files added since the last scan
- Statistics -> See your total integration time and breakdown by filter
